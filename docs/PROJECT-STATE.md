# PiDecoder project state

## Active version

- Development version: **v0.9.9.5 RC3**
- Branch: `feature/ptz-native-v0.9.9.5-rc2`
- Base version: v0.9.9.4 RC1
- Active phase: native PTZ field validation and release hardening

## Operational field state

Validated on the Raspberry Pi host:

- native RTSP mosaic: operational;
- native focus view: operational;
- digital inspection zoom and pan: operational;
- `pidecoder-config.service`: active;
- `pidecoder-ptz.service`: active;
- `pidecoder-wayland.path`: active;
- `pidecoder.service`: active;
- Axis Q6074 pan and tilt: operational;
- Axis Q6074 optical zoom: operational;
- Axis Q6074 native presets: operational;
- PTZ overlay auto-hide after five seconds: operational;
- fixed cameras do not display the PTZ overlay.

The Axis Q6074 ONVIF/PTZ metadata was restored and persisted in
`/opt/pidecoder/config/cameras.json`.

The repair helper was a one-time configuration repair. It is not a runtime
service and is no longer required once RC3 is installed.

## RC2 implementation completed

- persist `ptz_xaddr`, `ptz_profile_token` and PTZ presets in camera metadata;
- local Unix-datagram PTZ bridge at `/run/pidecoder/ptz.sock`;
- native PTZ overlay in the focus view;
- pan, tilt, optical zoom and forced Stop controls;
- native preset selector sending `GotoPreset` immediately;
- Stop on pointer release, pointer exit, focus loss, Escape and focus close;
- compact controls hidden after five seconds without mouse activity;
- overlay hidden automatically for cameras without valid PTZ metadata.

## RC3 hotfix completed

- browser camera synchronization preserves the existing `onvif` object;
- `/api/config` merges stored ONVIF metadata when an older browser tab omits it;
- changing camera resolution or FPS no longer removes PTZ endpoints, tokens or presets;
- using **Valeurs PiDecoder**, then saving and applying, preserves the native PTZ module;
- the digital zoom percentage is moved to the top-right corner;
- Web, installer and release-validator labels changed from RC2 to RC3.

## Field performance note

During testing, the Axis Q6074 showed additional latency when two high-frame-rate
streams were requested simultaneously.

Recommended field configuration:

- mosaic: 640 × 360 at 12 FPS;
- focus: 1920 × 1080 at 25 FPS.

Keep the mosaic stream lightweight when a camera has a strict simultaneous-stream
or aggregate-frame-rate limit.

## Configuration ownership

Runtime configuration remains under:

```text
/opt/pidecoder/config/cameras.json
/opt/pidecoder/config/layout.json
/opt/pidecoder/config/web-auth.json
```

The installer preserves these files during upgrades and stores complete installation
backups under:

```text
/var/backups/pidecoder/
```

Camera configuration and logs may contain private RTSP addresses or credentials.
Never commit runtime configuration or raw camera logs.

## Remaining validation before merge to main

1. Reboot the Raspberry Pi with RC3 installed.
2. Confirm all four services return `active`.
3. Confirm mosaic and focus video start automatically.
4. Confirm native PTZ movement works after reboot.
5. Confirm native preset selection works after reboot.
6. Apply **Valeurs PiDecoder** once more and confirm PTZ metadata remains present.
7. Review runtime logs and remove or redact full credential-bearing RTSP URLs before public release.
8. Update this file with the reboot result.
9. Merge the feature branch to `main`.
10. Create the release tag only after the final validation passes.

## Outside the current RC3 scope

- keyboard PTZ shortcuts;
- native PTZ speed adjustment;
- audio support;
- HTTPS;
- public REST API.
